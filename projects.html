                            Through these projects, I have honed my programming skills and applied them to tackle complex problems in the fields of social networks, game development, and optimization. These experiences have given me a strong foundation in machine learning and software engineering and have helped me develop the ability to translate abstract concepts into concrete solutions using code.

                            In this article, we have proposed an innovative approach to solve the influence maximization problem in social networks, which is critical for businesses and marketers to identify influential nodes and leverage them for maximum impact. Our approach combines both semantics and structural features of the network graph and uses a threshold of influence. We have also incorporated machine learning algorithms to identify influential nodes and optimize information diffusion.

                            This project involved developing a chess game in Python with a graphical user interface (GUI), that allows users to interact with the game. Additionally, we created an AI that is capable of playing chess against an intermediate user. This AI uses the minmax algorithm, which is a common algorithm for decision-making in games like chess, to search for the best move to make at each turn. To optimize this algorithm, we also implemented alpha-beta pruning, which is a technique for reducing the number of nodes that need to be searched in the game tree. With these techniques, our AI was able to win against an intermediate player.

                            The project focused on ant colony optimization and involved the development of a genetic algorithm to simulate this process. Ant colony optimization is a technique used in computer science and engineering to solve optimization problems. My genetic algorithm simulated the behavior of ant colonies and their foraging patterns to optimize the solution to the shortest path problem. Additionally, I created a graphical user interface to visualize the simulation in real-time. This allowed users to see the behavior of the simulated ants and track their foraging patterns as they evolved over time. This project involved a combination of programming skills and knowledge of optimization techniques to create a powerful tool for solving complex problems using ant colony optimization. The addition of the user interface made it easy for users to interact with and understand the results of the simulation.

                            In my recent project, I created a customized version of the popular game 2048 in C++. Along with the basic gameplay mechanics, I incorporated several additional features to make the game more engaging. One of the key features I added was an "undo" method that allowed players to reverse their last move and try a different approach. This added a new layer of strategy to the game and allowed players to experiment with different moves without the fear of making mistakes. Another feature I implemented was the ability to change the color of the game board or the font used for the game text. This allowed users to customize the game to their liking and make it more visually appealing. These modifications helped to create a unique version of 2048 that was both challenging and customizable, providing a fun and engaging experience for players.

                            I also have a wide variety of projects under my belt from game development to app creation and even parallel programming. Developing the Hangman game using Python was a great way to hone my programming skills while also creating something fun and engaging. Similarly, using Java for the Spider game and the Game of Life and implementing parallel programming was a challenging and rewarding endeavor. I was also able to create an Android application, specifically a currency converter. Finally, some other mini-projects, such as image compression, Hospitality-industry with SQL, and the Volcano website with HTML/CSS and JavaScript, helped me level-up diverse skills that can be applied in many different areas.
