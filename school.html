                            As a student, I pursued a challenging academic path. I began my higher education journey in "classes préparatoires aux grandes écoles", a two-year program designed to prepare students for admission to prestigious engineering schools. I then pursued my studies in engineering at École Centrale de Lyon, where I gained a solid foundation in various engineering disciplines, especially in computer science and mathematics. As a double curriculum student, I also studied for a bachelor's degree in mathematics at Claude Bernard University, expanding my knowledge in different fields of mathematics. My academic path has equipped me with a rigorous and diverse skill set, as well as the ability to excel in complex and demanding environments.

                            These preparatory classes are renowned for their high level of requirements and rigor, and students are prepared for demanding higher education studies. During these two years, I worked hard to acquire a solid education in mathematics, physics, and computer science, which are essential disciplines for engineering studies. My commitment and determination allowed me to effectively prepare for the engineering schools entrance exams, and I ultimately succeeded in securing a place in the prestigious engineering school "École Centrale de Lyon".

                            My studies at École Centrale de Lyon have been very interesting and challenging. As a student of Mathematics and Computer Science, I have been able to delve deeper into the theoretical foundations of these disciplines while also learning practical skills related to software engineering and machine learning. Through various projects and assignments, I have gained hands-on experience in developing software systems, implementing algorithms, and analyzing data. My focus on machine learning has given me a valuable skill set that is in high demand in many industries today.

                            My studies at Claude Bernard University have focused intensively on Mathematics, which is a discipline that requires both abstract reasoning and rigorous problem-solving skills. As a double curriculum student, I have been able to combine the theoretical knowledge gained in these mathematics courses with practical skills in engineering and computer science. Throughout my studies, I have been challenged with complex mathematical concepts such as analysis, probability and statistics, and algebra, while also learning how to apply mathematical methods to a variety of problems in fields such as physics, finance, and engineering. My education at Claude Bernard University has equipped me with a deep understanding of mathematical theory and its applications.
